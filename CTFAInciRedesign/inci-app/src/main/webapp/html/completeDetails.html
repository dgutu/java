	<h3>INCI Application – Complete Instructions</h3>
	<p />
	<p>
		One trade name per application may be submitted for an INCI name
		assignment.  All required fields on the application must be filled
		in.  Additional information may be submitted as an attachment in one
		of the following formats: <i>Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel,
			WordPerfect, Quattro Pro, pdf or rtf.  </i>Maximum file size per
		attachment is 8 MB.<i> </i>  Applications may be saved in progress;
		however, after an application is submitted, changes may not be made. 
		Non-refundable payment by credit card of $250 per application is made
		upon submission.  
	</p>
	<p />
	<p>The first screen in the application process instructs the
		applicant to select a category for their ingredient (listed below). 
		To print or view a pdf of the various applications by category, click
		on the links:</p>
	<ul class="ul1">
		<li>Biotechnology</li>
		<li>Botanicals</li>
		<li>Ferments</li>
		<li>General Chemistry</li>
		<li>Minerals/Inorganics</li>
		<li>Polymers/Silicones</li>
	</ul>
	<p />
	<p>Each category corresponds to a specific application which
		contains required fields about the ingredient’s identity and
		composition. Details about these fields are described as follows:</p>
	<p />
	<p>
		<b>Trade Name</b> – A trade name or commercial name for the ingredient
		should be provided.  Applicants that do not want their trade name or
		company name published should check “no” at the end of the application
		where it states:  “Do you want this trade name published in the <i>International
			Cosmetic Ingredient Dictionary</i> and supplier company name published in
		the Council's <i>International Buyers' Guide</i>?”
	</p>
	<p />
	<p>
		<b>Suggested Nomenclature</b> – Applicants may recommend an INCI
		name.  Suggested names should be based on INCI Conventions.  If you are submitting an ingredient that is similar to
		an existing INCI name, or relates to a trade name previously submitted
		by your company, be sure to provide this information.
	</p>
	<p />
	<p>
		<b>Chemical Structure </b>– Where applicable, structures may be
		submitted as attachments to the application. Descriptions for R
		groupings, (e.g., alkyl groups), or repeating units (e.g., moles
		ethylene oxide or propylene oxide) must be provided.
	</p>
	<p />
	<p>
		<b>Empirical Formula </b>– Provide where applicable.
	</p>
	<p />
	<p>
		<b>CAS Number</b> – Provide if available.  CAS Numbers are provided by
		the Chemical Abstracts Service and are unique numerical identifiers of
		chemical substances.
	</p>
	<p />
	<p>
		<b>EINECS/EC/ELINCS</b> – Provide if available.  EINECS/EC/ELINCS
		refer to unique identification numbers for chemical substances
		regulated in Europe (http://echa.europa.eu/).
	</p>
	<p />
	<p>
		<b>Chemical Synonyms</b> – Provide related chemical, technical or
		common names.
	</p>
	<p />
	<p>
		<b>Composition Statement</b> – If the final product is a blended
		mixture, identify the components in an organized list in descending
		order of predominance.  Indicate approximate percentages of each
		component when possible.  If the product is not a mixture, this field
		may be used to provide additional compositional information.
	</p>
	<p />
	<p>
		<b>Manufacturing Method</b> – A detailed, step-by-step manufacturing
		method must be provided, including complete identification of all
		starting materials.   <span class="s3">Please do not provide
			patents in place of a detailed method, or a definition similar to
			what is published in the Int’l Cosmetic Ingredient Dictionary</span>. 
		Specific instructions for what is needed in this field are included on
		the respective applications for each category.  Reaction schemes, flow
		charts or process diagrams are very helpful and may be added as an
		attachment. Preservatives used to protect the raw material are not
		typically included in the INCI name unless requested by the applicant.
		  <i>Note, proprietary information cannot be accepted.  If your
			application is marked “confidential”, it will be returned.</i>
	</p>
	<p />
	<p>
		<b>Solvents or Diluents</b> – List the name and relative percentage of
		any solvents or diluents present in the raw material <span class="s3">as
			it is sold for use in finished products.</span>
	</p>
	<p />
	<p>
		<b>Botanicals – </b>For this category, applicants must provide the
		genus, species and plant part for each botanical material in the
		product, and manufacturing information.  If specific component(s) is
		isolated, the manufacturing information should clearly describe the
		isolation technique, the relative % purity of the isolated fraction
		based on <span class="s3">dry weight</span>, the chemical identity of
		the fraction and method used to characterize its identity and purity. 
		If the product is a blend of several plant materials, applicants
		should attach an Excel spread sheet which identifies for each plant
		source:   the name of the genus in column 1, species in column 2 and
		plant part in column 3.  If more than one plant part is used for a
		given genus/species, list each part separated by a comma; state
		“whole” where entire plant is used, e.g.:

	<p>
		<b>Animal-Derived Ingredients </b>–For this category, applicants must
		include the identity of the animal and its genus/species, part of
		animal material is derived from, and step-by-step details for
		manufacturing method.  If a specific component is isolated, the %
		purity of the isolated fraction based on <span class="s3">dry
			weight</span> must be provided, its chemical identity and method used to
		characterize the identity and purity.   
	</p>
	<p />
	<p class="4">
		<b>Minerals and Inorganics</b> – Mineral composition information must
		be provided, along with manufacturing details. For mined materials,
		describe mining process and particle size of final product.  Attach
		X-ray diffraction pattern of product, synthesized and natural, in
		addition to a Bureau Standard.
	</p>
	<p />
	<p>
		<b>Polymers -</b> The manufacturing details must list all starting
		monomers, all cross-linking agents, and a reaction scheme that
		describes step-wise process.  For monomers that are alkoxylated, the
		degree of alkoxylation must be indicated (moles EO, PO, etc.)  The
		degree of polymerization of any polyether must be provided.  All R
		groups, (e.g., alkyl groups) must be disclosed.  
	</p>
	<p />
	<p>
		<b>Ferments</b> – Complete step-by-step details of the fermentation
		method should be provided in addition to a description of any
		downstream processing.   Products that are derived by spontaneous
		fermentation, or co-fermentation, should be specified.   The identity
		of the genus of all microorganisms must be provided; genus and species
		must be provided for pathogenic organisms<i>.   </i>If more than three
		plant materials are used in the fermentation process, applicants
		should attach an Excel spread sheet which identifies the genus of the
		microorganism in column 1; and for each plant source the genus in
		column 2, species in column 3, and plant part in column 4.  An
		additional column can be added to include other materials added to the
		fermentation tank, e.g., honey<i>:</i>

		<b>Biotech Ingredients</b> – Complete step-by-step manufacturing
		details must be provided. For ingredients derived by plant tissue
		culture, process details are very important; clearly indicate when a
		callus is isolated, and if the culture media is removed from the final
		preparation. For peptides, identify if the protein originates from a
		gene directly isolated from a human cell; or if it is a chemically
		synthesized copy of a human gene or gene fragment produced in a gene
		synthesizer. If the peptide is derived from other organisms, provide
		the common name and genus/species for the organism.   Provide the
		protein name and reference number; identify the total number of amino
		acids in the peptide; and attach a word document with complete amino
		acid sequence by single letter designation. If the peptide is a fusion
		peptide, provide the sequence for <span class="s3">each
			fragment</span> along with each corresponding protein name and protein
		reference numbers.   Provide % purity of the final protein and
		purification method.  If the final product is a blended mixture,
		identify the components in an organized list in descending order of
		predominance.  Indicate approximate percentages of each component when
		possible.

	<p />
	<p>
		<i>Applicants will be electronically notified of the INCI name
			assignment.  To facilitate the assignment process, please refrain
			from contacting the Council Science Department to inquire about
			application status; every effort is made to process applications as
			quickly as possible.</i>
	</p>
	<p />
	<p>
		<i>The INC reviews INCI names, both newly-assigned names and
			established names, on a continual basis.  Occasionally, revisions to
			INCI names must be made.  Suppliers are promptly notified of
			name-changes.  </i>
