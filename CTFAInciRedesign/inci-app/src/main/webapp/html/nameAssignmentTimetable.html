	<h3>INCI Application/Name Assignment Timetable</h3>
	<p>The International Nomenclature Committee (INC) meets
		approximately 5 times per year, generally during the months of
		February, April, June, September and November. Files are compiled in
		chronological order and distributed to the INC 6 weeks prior to the
		scheduled meeting date.</p>
	<p>Applicants are notified of the INCI name assignment via email
		generally within 2 weeks of the INC meeting. The average amount of
		time to receive an INCI name assignment is about 3 months after an
		application has been submitted, providing there is no need for further
		information after INC review.</p>
	<p>It is not unusual for an application to take 6 months for
		completion, depending on the number of applications received, date of
		submission with respect to the scheduled INC meeting, and clarity of
		compositional and manufacturing details provided on the application.
		To facilitate the assignment process, applicants should provide all
		requested information on the application, and respond promptly to any
		inquiries posted about the application that are sent via email through
		the application site. Additionally, to further facilitate the process
		responses to inquiries should be posted in the "comments
		box", of the application and not sent to Council staff.</p>
	<p>Please note that Council staff resources are limited and
		therefore it is helpful to if emails requesting application status are
		curtailed. Notification is provided throughout the process via the
		INCI application site, and every effort is made internally to process
		applications in an efficient manner. Your cooperation is appreciated.</p>
