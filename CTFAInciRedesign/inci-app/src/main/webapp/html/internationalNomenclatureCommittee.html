	<h3>The International Nomenclature Committee</h3>
	<p>
		The International Cosmetic Ingredient Nomenclature Committee (INC),
		sponsored by the Personal Care Products Council, is comprised of
		dedicated scientists from industry, academia, regulatory authorities
		and sister associations who volunteer their time to serve the global
		cosmetic industry community. The INC is charged with the
		responsibility of designating INCI names. INCI names are uniform,
		systematic names internationally recognized to identify cosmetic
		ingredients. In the United States and many countries around the world,
		INCI names are referenced by regulation for ingredient labeling
		cosmetic products. As part of the process of coining INCI names, the
		INC oversees the continued development of the INCI nomenclature
		system, and assures the integrity of the information related to INCI
		names that is published in the <i>International Cosmetic
			Ingredient Dictionary and Handbook</i>.
	</p>
	<p>Members of the INC convene approximately five times a year for
		2-day sessions to review applications for new INCI names, and
		petitions for INCI name changes. Applications are addressed in date
		order, and INCI names are designated on a consensus basis in
		accordance with the conventions developed since the nomenclature
		effort was initiated in the 1970s. In between meetings, the INC
		participates in web-based conferencing to review monograph development
		for INCI names. Additionally, the INC responds to other matters
		related to The Dictionary, nomenclature development, and international
		nomenclature harmonization.</p>
