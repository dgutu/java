	<h3>Welcome to the INCI Name Application System!</h3>
	<h4>The INCI Application is required for the assignment of an INCI
		name to a cosmetic ingredient.</h4>
	<p>
		<i>First-time users, please read the important information below.</i>

	<p>
		<u>Background</u><br /> International Nomenclature Cosmetic
		Ingredient (INCI) names are uniform, systematic names internationally
		recognized to identify cosmetic ingredients. In the United States and
		many countries around the world, INCI names are referenced by
		regulation for ingredient labeling cosmetic products. INCI names are
		developed by the International Nomenclature Committee (INC) and
		published in the International Cosmetic Ingredient Dictionary and
		Handbook. The Dictionary, and on-line versions of the Dictionary, is
		available from the Personal Care Products Council’s e-bookstore: <a
			href="http://www.personalcarecouncil.org" target="_blank">www.personalcarecouncil.org</a>.

	<p>
		<u>General Procedure</u><br /> INCI names are designated by the
		International Nomenclature Committee (INC) through an application
		process. Applications must be filled out in English and submitted
		electronically. Only one trade name may be submitted per application,
		and there is a non-refundable fee of $250.00 per application payable
		by credit card upon submission of the completed application.
		Applicants may save their information during the filing process,
		however once the application is submitted it cannot be retrieved for
		editing.
	</p>
	<p>
		<u>INCI Application Processing</u><br /> After an INCI application is
		submitted, the process for an INCI name assignment progresses through
		a series of steps:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>When payment is verified, the applicant is notified by email;
			the application is then initially reviewed for completeness.</li>
		<li>An email notification is sent to the applicant when the
			initial review has been performed.</li>
		<li>The application is again reviewed for adequate disclosure of
			composition and manufacturing information.</li>
		<li>An email notification is sent to the applicant if additional
			information is required.</li>
		<li>Applications determined to require full INC review are
			compiled in chronological order and distributed to INC members 6
			weeks prior to the scheduled meeting date. Applicants are notified
			with this information.</li>
		<li>Applications that may be processed without full INC review
			are circulated among members as needed and assigned nomenclature.</li>
		<li>Applicants are notified from the INCI site by email with the
			assigned INCI name.</li>
	</ol>
	<p></p>
	<p>
		<i>To ensure proper communication throughout the application
			process and avoid delays, it is imperative that your email server
			accepts mail from <a href="mailto:inci@personalcarecouncil.org">inci@personalcarecouncil.org</a>.
