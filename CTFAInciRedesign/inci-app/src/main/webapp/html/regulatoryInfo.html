	<h3>Regulatory Information</h3>
	<p>The designation of an INCI name for a cosmetic ingredient does
		not imply that the substance is safe for use as a cosmetic ingredient,
		nor does it indicate that its use as a cosmetic ingredient complies
		with the laws and regulations of the United States or any other
		country. INCI names do not imply standards or grades of purity.</p>
	<p>The assignment of an INCI name does not imply that the
		ingredient is &ldquo;approved,&rdquo; &ldquo;certified,&rdquo; or
		&ldquo;endorsed&rdquo; by the Council or any other organization or
		governmental body. Conversely, if an ingredient does not have an INCI
		name, it does not mean that the ingredient may not or should not be
		used in finished cosmetic and personal care products.</p>
	<p>
		INCI names published in the International Cosmetic Ingredient
		Dictionary and Handbook are recognized by the U.S. Food and Drug
		Administration as the labeling names that must be used for cosmetic
		ingredient labeling under U.S. regulation 21 CFR 701.3. This
		recognition of the Dictionary does not imply that the ingredients
		contained therein are considered to be &ldquo;safe&rdquo; or
		&ldquo;approved&rdquo; for use by the FDA.
	</p>
	<p>
		<i>NOTE: The suitability for use of any ingredient as a component
			of a finished cosmetic product is solely the responsibility of the
			finished product manufacturer.</i>
	</p>
	<p>
		Manufacturers intending to produce and/or market cosmetic products in
		the United States are urged to consult applicable regulations. These
		regulations may be found in the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations,
		Title 21 (21 CFR). Additionally, the U.S. Food and Drug
		Administration's website for cosmetics is an excellent source of
		regulatory information: <a href="http://www.fda.gov">www.fda.gov</a>.
		Manufacturers are also urged to check notices in the U.S. Federal
		Register and to familiarize themselves with state laws and regulations
		that may provide additional information regarding the manufacture and
		sale of cosmetic products. For detailed information on the labeling of
		cosmetic and personal care products in the United States, see the
		current edition of the Council's Labeling Manual, available in
		the Council's e-bookstore: <a href="http://www.personalcarecouncil.org">www.personalcarecouncil.org</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Firms marketing products in countries outside the United States should
		consult the laws and regulations in those countries for information on
		their legal requirements. For information on the laws and regulations
		of many countries, see the latest edition of the International
		Regulatory/ Resource Manual, or the International Cosmetic Legal and
		Regulatory Database, <a href="http://irdb.personalcarecouncil.org/">irdb.personalcarecouncil.org/</a>,
		both available from the Council.
